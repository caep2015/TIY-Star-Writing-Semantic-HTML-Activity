## Solution Files
This project doesn't include solution files.

## Resources
The resources folder contains files designed to help you complete the activity. This will include screen shots of the completed HTML and files containing the text.

### Screen Shots
Screen shots of the final code are provided for reference. Feel free to compare your rendered code with the screen shots as you work. When you render your code, it should (generally) resemble the screen shots.

NOTES: You may want to resize the width of your browser to roughly match the screen shot

### Text Files
Additionally, the text for each page is provided so that you don't have to type it word by word from the screen shots. Some pages may include images. URLs for the images are provided in the text files.
